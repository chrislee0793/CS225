CS225
=====

My MPs and labs from CS225 at UIUC, posted for anyone to look at. The university doesn't archive previous versions of the class site, so I can't find what exactly each MP is supposed to do. However, most of them are pretty self-explanatory.

Also, many of these were done with a partner.

Why would I post this?
======================

I'm fully aware that these can easily be used to cheat from. I'd like to point out, though, that these have all been submitted before and will therefore show up in the cheat detector, so don't even try it. Feel free to look at them and learn how things work, but when it comes to actually doing your own MP, copying my code will only end up hurting you.

For everyone else, these assignments may serve as helpful examples of programming concepts not unlike the thousands of other ones on the internet. Maybe they'll help you if you couldn't understand any of the other ones, maybe not.

Also hey, maybe some potential employers want to get a taste of the code I wrote in the spring of 2013, who knows?

Compiling and Running
=====================

Each MP and lab has its own Makefile, just run make and you'll be golden. Some of the labs and MPs require OpenMP, libpng, and maybe ImageMagick to be installed, so install those if you're having compiler errors.

Most of these can be run by simply executing the output, but others may require console arguments; those that do will yell at you if you try to execute them without.

Accuracy
========

The autograder output for each MP and lab is in the folder in plaintext format so you can see what I got right and wrong. Most of them are > 90%, but not all are perfect. Keep that in mind if you're trying to learn off my code.
